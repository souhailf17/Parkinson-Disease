🎚️ Extracting Multiple Audio Features: Utilized feature extraction techniques such as MFCC, Chroma, Spectral Centroid, Zero Crossing Rate, Spectral Rolloff, Tonnetz, Spectral Contrast, Pitch, and Jitter.

🔄 Standardizing Audio Signals: Standardized audio inputs to ensure uniform data processing across diverse recordings.

🤖 Constructing, Training, and Assessing Machine Learning Models: Developed and trained various models, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost, ANN, and Bagging, to detect patterns and provide predictions. Conducted comprehensive evaluations and optimizations to enhance model performance.

🚀 Creating a Web Application with Flask: Engineered a user-friendly web interface using Flask, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application enables users to record their voices and offers predictions related to Parkinson's disease based on the trained models.
